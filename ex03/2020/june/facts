fact 1

According to Jean Reno, he decided to play Léon as if he were "a little mentally slow" and emotionally repressed. 
He felt that this would make audiences relax and realize that he wasn't someone who would take adivantage of a vulnerable young girl. 
Reno claims that for Léon, the possibility of a physical relationship with Mathilda is not even conceivable, and as such, 
during the scenes when such a relationship is discussed, Reno very much allowed Portman to be emotionally in control of the scenes.

However, the audience became extremely uncomfortable and began to laugh nervously, completely destroying the tone of the film.

Luc Besson decided to cut the scene for theatrical release.
